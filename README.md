# Wuhan novel coronavirus analysis

## Master to-do list
- [ ] Work out how changes in the value of `k`, the correlation between serial interval and incubation period, change model runs.
- [ ] Produce new graphs, descriptions of each in comments in the google doc
- [ ] Write up results
- [ ] Send round nCov working group
- [ ] Pre-print first draft

This outbreak contains code sent over by Adam and Alicia for branching process simulation from *Effectiveness of Ring Vaccination as a Control Strategy for Ebola Virus Disease* by Kucharski et al (2016):
https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/22/1/15-1410_article

## Parameters

### Parameter overview from Fraser et al. 

* Parameter estimates from SARs: 
	* R0: 2-4
	* Incubation period of 4.25 days with a variance of 14.25
	* Infectiousness over time: "can be inferred from viral shedding data (5), which peaks 5â€“10 days after onset of symptoms. To maximize , we chose a low variance distribution (var = 0.1 * mean^2) and a peak at 9.25 days after infection, yielding theta < 11%"

### Parameter overview from Campbell et al.

* *Bayesian inference of transmission chains using timing of symptoms, pathogen genomes and contact data* by Campbell et al
	* Table 2 has references for many epidemiological parameters of SARS-cov
	* https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006930#sec006

### Wuhan data

* http://virological.org/t/epidemiological-data-from-the-ncov-2019-outbreak-early-descriptions-from-publicly-available-data/337
* https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1itaohdPiAeniCXNlntNztZ_oRvjh0HsGuJXUJWET008/edit#gid=0

### Other ideas
* Robin has data describing the proportion of cases for Wuhan with specific symptoms (fever, cough, shortness of breath, breathing difficulties (requires oxygen), chest pain, low white blood cell count). By comparing these with SARS, influenza etc we could potentially get a (very rough) idea of the level of symptoms for Wuhan vs other diseases, which could in turn (with some assumptions) inform the percentage of transmissions occurring from missed cases/in isolation (since that is already known for other pathogens)? Would need some thought...
	
## Usage

### Set up
* Installing the package is annoying because this is a private repository. You will need to set up a github personal access token (PAT), there is a step by step guide here: https://happygitwithr.com/github-pat.html
* You can then run the command `devtools::install_github("epiforecasts/ringbp")`
* Alternatively, if you are hoping to develop the package, clone this github repository to your own computer and open the R project file.

### Run an analysis

To check your package is working correctly, try to run some simulations with the following:

```r
# Run 100 simulations
res <- wuhan_sim(n.cores = 6,n.sim = 100,wvaccYN = 0,define_6m = 20*7,initial.cases.pcluster = 6,
          initial.clusters = 10, prop.ascertain = 0.2, cap_cases = 4500, cap_max_days = 350,
          r0within = 0.3, r0Am = 2.5, overkkmiss = 2, overkk = 0.16, vefficacy = 0.975,
          vuptake = 0.90, ring.size = 150, time_to_protection = 0, incub_mean = 7, 
          incub_var = 5, inf_mean = 7, inf_var = 5, delay_var = 2, 
          delay_mean = 7,time_to_isolation=0,outbreak_df_out = TRUE)


# plot(x=seq(0,10,0.1),y=dgamma(seq(0,10,0.1),shape = 1.4114166,rate=0.3261129),type="l")

# Plot of daily cases
# ggplot(data=res$outbreak_df, aes(x=day, y=number, col=as.factor(n.sim)))+
#   geom_line(show.legend = FALSE, alpha=0.1)+
#   scale_y_continuous(name="Number of cases")+ theme_bw()+
#   geom_line(aes(x=day, y=mean.number), col="black")

# Plot of weekly cases
ggplot(data=res$outbreak_df_week, aes(x=week, y=number, col=as.factor(n.sim)))+
  geom_line(show.legend = FALSE, alpha=0.3)+
  scale_y_continuous(name="Number of cases")+ theme_bw()+
  geom_line(aes(x=week, y=mean.number), col="black")

res$outbreak_df_week %>% arrange(n.sim) %>% group_by(n.sim) %>% mutate(cs=c(cumsum(number))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x=week,y=cs,col=as.factor(n.sim))) + geom_line(show.legend = FALSE,alpha=0.3) + theme_bw() + ylab("Cumulate cases") + xlab("weeks since outbreak start") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=0:20)

# Proportion of runs that have 0 weekly cases in weeks 10-12 after outbreak
extinct_prob(res$outbreak_df_week)
```

## Docker 

This analysis was developed in a docker container based on the tidyverse docker image. 

To build the docker image run (from the `wuhan_ncov` directory):

```bash
docker build . -t wuhan_ncov
```

To run the docker image run:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 --name wuhan_ncov -e USER=wuhan_ncov -e PASSWORD=wuhan_ncov wuhan_ncov
```

The rstudio client can be found on port :8787 at your local machines ip. The default username:password is wuhan_ncov:wuhan_ncov, set the user with -e USER=username, and the password with - e PASSWORD=newpasswordhere. The default is to save the analysis files into the user directory.

To mount a folder (from your current working directory - here assumed to be `tmp`) in the docker container to your local system use the following in the above docker run command (as given mounts the whole `wuhan_ncov` directory to `tmp`).

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
--mount type=bind,source=$(pwd)/tmp,target=/home/wuhan_ncov
```

To access the command line run the following:

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
docker exec -ti wuhan_ncov bash
```
